      <p>
        Hello, my name is Rosi Molina. I am 21 years old, and I was born and raised in Santa Rosa, CA. I am a home baker, doing what I love.
        Since I was little, I was into baking. When I was six years old, and I would get home from school with recipe books for cupcakes. 
        At age eight, I started baking using store bought cake mix. This was simple since all it required was eggs, oil and water, 
        to be added to the cake mix. After a couple years, I started diving deeper into my interests. In high school, 
        I started taking culinary classes and this is also when I started baking things from scratch. This is where the fun began for me. 
        Culinary classes taught me more about different ways that I can explore my passion for baking.
      </p>
      <p>
        My values
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an artisan baker. 
        This means making things by hand and starting everything from the bottom up. 
        This means that I make the dough, the jellies, and more. Rather than using pre made things, 
        I make everything from scratch at home. This gives me the opportunity to really have control with what I put into my products so 
        that I can craft the best sweets for my customers.
